### Node-Summit-Code-of-Conduct

## Summary
Node Summit and its owner, Asynch Media, are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, experience and religious or other beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers and staff.

## Details
Part of the success of the Node.js community is due to the fact many early members have a strong bias towards inclusion and respect. As a participant of a Node Summit event you are helping support the goal of a strong, vibrant, inclusive and diverse Node.js community where everyone feels welcome and safe.

We are committed to providing a harassment free event experience and this is only possible if participants are equally committed to this objective.

Participants include everyone involved in a Node Summit event; attendees, speakers, sponsors, staff, vendors, volunteers and gate crashers.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, experience and religious or other beliefs. It also includes displaying sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other sessions, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so may qualify you for free escort out of the event and exclusion from future Node Summit events.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers will take any actions they deem appropriate and necessary, including but not limited to warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please notify a member of the conference staff immediately. The staff will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe and welcome for the duration of the conference.

*PLEASE NOTE:  If you, as an individual or collectively as an organization, do not believe you can or do not want to comply with this Code of Conduct, please do not attend a Node Summit event. The videos from the event will be available at a later date and you can view the content online without the risk of detracting from the event experience for other participants. If you find yourself in this situation and already purchased an event pass please notify the conference organizers prior to the start of the conference by sending an email to events@nodesummit.com and including the phrase “CoC Opt-Out” in the subject line. We will provide a full refund on your ticket purchase and the reason for this refund will be not be shared with anyone.*
